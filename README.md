This repository contains the code examples and exercises for my lectures on quantum computing at the Czech Technical University in Prague. 
The course information is here: https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/cz/education/bk/predmety/74/72/p7472006

The code is written in Python/Julia and covers various topics such as quantum random walks, quantum annealing, variational quantum algorithms and aspects of the applications of quantum computing in finance.
